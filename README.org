* Pure joy that comes from learning Clojure!

  Store for Exercism jobs I complete on Clojure track.

  Although I do exercise on Mentored mode I just mark exercise
  done if all of the tests pass.

** Agenda
   The plan is to just to do small part of Clojure exercises
   in order to keep the contribution to the GitHub repository and
   still be on the learning track. Consistency is a key, they say.

** TODO
   - Fix the Armstrong Numbers solution according to the mentor's feedback
     https://exercism.io/my/solutions/85eff4ea1855455badb99ac75c1221ab
   - Nucleotide count exercise
     as a new one to the repository.
